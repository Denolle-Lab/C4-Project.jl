    "# Script for Creating Flexible Nodal Moveout Plots \n",
    "Designed for use with the seisbasin `source_processed/` dataset. The script leverages the following 4 file-level attributes for use in plotting: `source`, `component`, `stacktype`, and optional `filter`. These detail which source station the file comes from, which correlation component `(EE, NN, ZZ)` is being used, and we provide an option to filter the correlations by ID. For example if you want to plot the B4 array, set filter to `\"B4\"` or more specifically (to avoid false positives) `NO.SB4`. Also of note, we plot the anti-causal side of the correlations as for these datafiles the anti-causal has a stronger signal-to-noise ratio. We also provide a parameter to make plots using PGD and PGV - set `n_derivatives = 1` for PGD and `2` for PGV. (Arbitrarily many discrete derivatives can be calculated if desired)"
